.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width = 70%]

*1. UiClassDiagram* depicts FitHelper UI classes, their internal relationship, and the connection with Logic and Model components. +
The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PagePane`, `ButtonList`, `CurrentPageTitle` etc.
Moreover, it reserves a place for different pages to be displayed. +
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

.Sequence Diagram for Today Feature
image::InitiateTodayPageSequenceDiagram.png[]


*2. InitialTodayPageSequenceDiagram* illustrates how components interact with each other when `Today Page` is initialized. +
The UI component passes through the Logic component to fetch `entryList` stored in FitHelper Model.
`Today Page` is then fed with the data of `todayEntryList` and displays it in GUI list view.

'''

.Activity Diagram for FitHelper Commit Feature
image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[width = 20%]


*3. CommitActivityDiagram* summarizes the activities happened when the user executes an `undo` command. +
If user's intended command is "undoable", the `currentStatePointer` is moved backward in the `FitHelperStateList`, and the redundant states are purged.
Otherwise the command is discarded.

'''

.Sequence Diagram for Diary Feature
image::DiarySequenceDiagram.png[]

*4. DiarySequenceDiagram* illustrates how FitHelper adds a diary to the storage through the interaction between different components. +
User input is taken in through UI, handled to LogicManager, converted to an `addDiary` command through the parsers, and finally added to the diary storage.

.Sequence Diagram for Undo Feature
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

*5. UndoSequenceDiagram* depicts the interaction between different components of FitHelper, namely Logic and Model, when an `undo` command is executed.
The LogicManager handles the command by converting it to an `UndoCommand` through the `UndoCommandParser`. In command execution, the Model takes
in the `undoFitHelper` call from the Logic and rollbacks the current `VersionedFitHelper` to the previous state marked by the `currentStatePointer`.
The command result is returned to Logic, and finally reflected and displayed by UI.
